== Definitions

=== The project
A project is a *unique* process, consisting of a set of coordinated and
mastered activities with start and end dates. It must achieve a goal that
complies with specific *quality* requirements, with *cost* constraints and *time* delivery limits.

image::quality/QCT.png[caption="Figure 01:", title="Quality, Budget, time limits are interdependent"]

These constraints of quality, costs and deadlines set the *scope* of the project. They are
interdependent: "win" on one often "lose" on one or the other.

IT project activities create *deliverables*: tools, methods or services computer.

=== Actors and their roles

The project is done primarily by men and women. These individuals are
grouped into entities that are all legal persons (a company, a service or a team individuals, ...).
Each of these entities assumes one or more responsibilities (plan, design, develop, test, ...)
which, if properly conducted, will lead to the success of the project.

During the realization phase of a project, we can distinguish two particular entities:

* the *client*: also called Project Owner, this is the one who expresses the *need*.
* the *supplier*: also called Project Supervisor, it is the one that responds to the need.
In addition to the customer and its supplier, other entities may be involved in the
project. These are the end users of the solution, the organizations financing the project, and so on.

You must keep in mind that this separation of responsabilities is typical of some countries like France and
do not apply everywhere. In Anglo-saxon culture, project are more ofte, managed by people who have the dual
skills (express the needs and development managing)


=== Project Owner
The contracting authority is at the origin of the project. It is the entity  who sets the objectives that are needed to complete, as well as project costs and deadlines.
It has the functional knowledge of the field in which the project is that the framework in which the project must exist, and the expectation of the features it will have.
This is the owner at the end of the project. It is the one who pays.

=== Project Supervisor
The project supervisor provides the product expected by the project owner. It is the one who ensures
quality, costs and deadlines.
It can get help from one or more suppliers. It has the responsibility to coordinate and supervise its providers.
Project supervisor is the one who realizes.

Quality of software
When we talk about the quality of software, we are talking about several characteristics
different, themselves broken down into sub-characteristics (or attributes).
All features of a software do not necessarily have the same importance for a
given organization. This is why each organization defines its own quality model,
sometimes with several models applicable to its various software products. In particular,
each organization defines its own methods (metrics) to assess the degree of presence
different quality attributes.
The main standards used for the definition of quality model (s): ISO / IEC 9126
(old version) and ISO / IEC 25010 (new version).
In these standards, the term software is used in a broad sense. It can refer to both the code
source, executables, libraries, architecture documents, and so on. In
consequence, the concept of user may also apply, depending on the characteristic and / or
considered software, to a client or a developer, for example.

"Over-quality"
Sometimes it's called "over-quality" to realize a feature while it's not
specified.


The usual interpretation is then:
Achieving a requested functionality is normal: this is what software quality is.
Not performing a feature while it is requested degrades the quality of the software.
Not performing a feature that is not requested is normal.
But to realize a functionality whereas this one is not requested is a loss or a
loss of profit for the supplier, since the customer will not pay to obtain
something he did not ask!
Although quite defensible, this way of summarizing the "over-quality" is limiting. It is
possible to interpret the situation in a more nuanced way, by asking the question:
is the feature considered useful or unnecessary for the customer? This question expresses
perfectly the difference between the need as expressed by the customer and the real need of the customer
(see the need analysis phase).

We then have the following interpretation:
Performing a requested functionality is normal if it is useful.
Achieving a requested but useless functionality can mean a lack in the phase
need analysis.
Do not realize a feature while it is requested is a fault of the provider.
However, if the unrealized feature proves useless for the customer, it will not be
maybe not embarrassed by his absence.
Not performing a feature that is not requested is normal.
But if the unrealized feature would have been ultimately helpful to the customer? This is a
opportunity for product improvement ...
To realize a functionality whereas this one is not requested is:
a loss for the provider, effectively, if the feature in question is useless.
a way to meet the needs of the customer, and therefore a proof of the quality of the
service provided by the supplier, which proves that he has better understood the real need of the
client than the client himself.
With this alternative view, "over-quality" can become a commercial asset.


Phases of existence
Needs Analysis / Feasibility / Terms of Reference
This phase makes it possible to collect the data necessary to give an account of the real situation.
It is first necessary to understand the context, using all sources of information
relevant. The main source of information is the customer, to whom any useful questions must be asked,
by not hesitating to deepen: some vital elements are sometimes so obvious / implicit
for the customer he does not think to mention them.
Then, putting into perspective the needs expressed by the context allows to redefine or
validate the real needs. These real needs should be ordered by degree of importance and
can be grouped by themes.
In this phase are also established the different design parameters, and in particular the
constraints that may prevent some or all of the original objectives from being achieved. The
technical or economic constraints are not the only ones to consider; some areas
are also affected by legal, social, environmental, and so on.
The analysis phase leads to the validation by the MOA of a realistic and
suited to his real needs. This document clearly specifies the tasks to be performed as well as
estimated time needed for each.
This phase also allows the MOE to assess that it has access to all skills
necessary for the project, or if the use of external resources is necessary.
Preliminary study
Upstream of the need analysis phase, an even earlier phase of study can be found
prior. While the need analysis is intended to be precise and exhaustive, the preliminary study aims to
simply to make a first round and to set the perimeter.
The pre-study phase is not intended to be exhaustive, but to guide the following phases (including
including detailed needs analysis).
Example of analysis tools
Five Ws
4 questions: Who? What? Or ? When?
Completed by 3 modalities: How? How many ? Why ?
An English equivalent is the Five W's: Who, What, Where, When, Why? Used by journalists
for writing their articles.
Method of 5 Why
Ask five questions successively starting with Why can we better understand the
the real cause of a problem.
Pareto Diagram
Such a diagram represents in graphic form the different causes of a problem,
ordered by their importance.
It is an application of the 80/20 law (or Pareto principle): 20% of causes produce 80%



Diagram of Ishikawa
Also called 5M or fish bones, this diagram makes it possible to relate the causes and
the effects.
Materials in play
Hardware: equipment, machinery, software, technologies
Operating method, logic
Human labor
Environment: environment, context




Specification
In the specification phase, the need that was analyzed earlier is described with more
in the form of requirements that the solution must satisfy.
A specification document can be of two main types:
A functional specification describes the business processes in which the solution
intervenes. For example, the units used, the rules of calculation or interaction, etc. The
Functional specification represents the goal to be achieved.
A technical specification describes the technical environment in which the solution fits.
For example, architectural design, exchange data format with components
already present, the programming languages ​​used, the format of the databases, the
host system, ... can be fixed in this document. The technical specification represents
the means to achieve the goal set by the functional part.
This phase often leads to more than one specification document. In particular,
requirements can be refined more and more during this phase until reaching a
satisfactory level of detail: then general and then more detailed specifications can be created.
Most often, it is the MOA that is at the origin of the general specifications. It can however
be relevant that the detailed specifications are rather written by the MOE.
Because it tells future users and developers what the finished product will look like, the
specification allows for cost and duration estimates. It serves as a basis for
establish the project schedule.
The specification also serves as a contractual basis. After this phase, all the features that
are out-specification do not have to be neither requested nor paid by the customer.
Design
While the specification phase is intended to describe the solution from the outside, the
design describes it from the inside. While the specification phase describes the constraints, the
design brings solutions.
This is the work of the MOE.
Like all documentation, it can be refined more and more, for example in a document
preliminary / architectural design, then detailed.
Implementation / Development
This phase consists of the realization of the solution as it was conceived.
tests
Testing the software as implemented is intended to improve the quality or knowledge of the
degree of presence of a particular quality.
A test consists of the partial verification of the software. It corresponds to the combination of three
things:
input data
an object to test
an expected situation
If the expected situation corresponds to the situation observed during the test, it is a sign of the quality
of the software.


Integration
During the integration phase, each module of the software is integrated and tested as a whole.
Also called functional tests, this phase aims to verify the functional aspect (including
performance, stability, etc.), sometimes not detectable by lower level tests.
Validation
During the validation phase, the system is tested as a whole, and in an environment
getting closer to the final environment. The purpose is to assess its conformity with the
specified requirements.
A particular type of validation is the recipe. It takes place in the presence of all the actors
(MOA and MOE). It often precedes an important milestone in the life of the project, such as a delivery.
Deployment
The deployment of a software consists in its putting into production, ie to make it available
and usable for the customer as well as for its end users.
This phase can be broken down into several steps that will apply (or not) to a project
particular.
Delivery (release, packaging)
The different components of the solution are prepared to make them usable.
Activation (install, activation)
The solution is made usable in its production environment. His different
components are installed and configured.
Disabling (uninstall, deactivation)
A previous solution may have to be totally or partially uninstalled or
disabled to allow the new solution to replace it.
Update (update)
The new solution may require a newer version of dependencies already present
in its production environment. It can also be part of a larger system, which
must then be updated to enable the activation of the solution.
The deployment of the same solution can be done several times. This phase makes
essential the use of a version manager as well as a manager of
configuration.
Operation / Maintenance
Software may have to evolve even after being delivered in the course of
maintenance.
Maintenance can be of several types:
Corrective maintenance consists of resolving an anomaly
corrective maintenance
It corrects the anomaly permanently.
palatial maintenance
It prevents the anomaly from damaging the system on the client environment, while
allowing the software to continue to fulfill all or part of its features.
However, since its impact is necessarily negative to a certain degree, this type
maintenance is often of a temporary nature.
Preventive maintenance consists of intervening on a software before an anomaly
occurs. This type of maintenance can be systematic or conditional.
Scalable maintenance can better meet the need or respond to new ones
needs by modifying existing software or developing new features.
The maintenance differs from the other phases in that the software in question is already in
production.
